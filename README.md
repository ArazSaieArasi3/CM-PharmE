## Abstract

Pharmaceutical ecosystems involve multi-layered interactions across organizational, regulatory, and digital domains, demanding a coherent conceptual foundation to capture their dynamics. Previous frameworks have rarely combined business architecture with ontology, leaving ecosystem-level interactions only partially represented. This study addresses these gaps by proposing a business-architecture-informed conceptual framework grounded in the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO). Importantly, the framework positions business architecture as a bridge to enterprise architecture, ensuring that ecosystem-level conceptualization aligns with organizational structures and strategic objectives. The framework was developed through a systematic literature review (PRISMA-guided) of 17 peer-reviewed studies (2018–2025) and a qualitative thematic synthesis. It formalizes key components and relationships across domains to ensure semantic coherence and structural clarity. The proposed model contributes to advancing theory and provides a reference for ontology-based system design, strategic governance, and policy development in pharmaceutical contexts. Furthermore, the framework offers extensibility for future adaptation at both the enterprise and ecosystem levels, supporting broader applicability in digital health, regulatory alignment, and inter-organizational collaboration.
