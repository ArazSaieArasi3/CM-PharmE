## Relation patterns
No object property has an explicit formal endpoint in this module.

Properties with an unspecified OWL endpoint remain unspecified; this page does not infer the missing endpoint.

## Constraints and protected distinctions
No Gate-D protected distinction is registered specifically for this module.

For executable constraints and validation evidence, see [[V2 Formal Ontology and SHACL]] and [[V2 Evaluation E1-E13|CM-PharmE 2.0 Evaluation Framework]].

## Modeling decisions
This module belongs to the **Extension** layer in the approved 17-domain V2 review taxonomy. Its definition and concept ownership come from the V2 domain review catalog and integrated conceptual model. The generated page does not move, split, merge or approve concepts.

## Structural example
No explicit domain–range pair is selected as a module example.

This is a structural relation example, not an instance-data claim.
